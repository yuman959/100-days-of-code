# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 30 2016

**Today's Progress**: I completed 200 challenges on FreeCodeCamp and I'm 25 challenges away from finishing JavaScript module

**Thoughts:** Lots of progress! :-)

### Day 2: Jan 2 2017

**Today's Progress**: The challenge exercise for arrays/objects was a bit confusing but I worked it out. Started functional programming module.

**Thoughts**: I like the arrays/objects challenge. It's just like lists & tables.

### Day 3: Jan 3 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half way to functional programming (advanced objects topic)

**Thoughts** I find it hard to transition to the constructor concept (this expression). The example challenge is very confusing - I just haven't seen enough use cases yet. It will get better.

### Day 4: Jan 5 2017

**Today's Progress**: Array method is fun and intuitive! Moved through them quickly. Onto the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges!

**Thoughts**

### Day 5: Jan 7 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on challenges that manipulate strings (split, join, case, pick certain string character etc.)

**Thoughts** There are always multiple ways to solve the same problem. It helps with collateral thinking and critical thinking.

### Day 6: Jan 15 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 4 challenges in basic algorithm scripting.

**Thoughts**: Got really busy last week. Will try to stay on course.

### Day 7: Jan 21 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck on the filter false boolean value for a couple of days.. In the end the solution is incredibly simple.
**Thoughts**
Getting more comfortable with quickly learning different method and apply it in the challenge. Hopefully wrap up the challenges soon!

### Day 8: Feb 5 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished JSON APIs and AJAX. Getting started with intermediate front end projects!

**Thoughts** It's been a while since the update. The Basic Algorithm Scripting is quite challenging especially towards the end and took me days to fully solve and understand one problem. Very hard to enforce the daily coding schedule. Def. will be more consistent next week.

### Day 9: Feb 11 2017

**Today's Progress**: After struggling for a couple of days for APIs, I finally got a little hang of it and started building simple API with python (following my previous technical marketing course).
**Thoughts**  API is a really interesting topic b/c learning how to connect with and leverage other apps are super fun and useful. Beneficial for work too. Good timing!

### Day 10: Feb 26 2017

**Today's Progress**: Got stuck on the first API project - Random Quotes Machine for a long time! Asked friend for help! Finally made it working!

**Thoughts**  Consistent with progress and effort. Ask help if needed

### Day 11: Jan 7=27 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished the first API exercise - Random Quotes Machine!

**Thoughts**  Great learning experience. Very stuck. But researching + asking friends help a lot. Looking forward to the next API project!

### Day 12: Mar 3 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on the Weather API!

**Thoughts**  Errors encountered: have to add jQuery library; delete http:// for codepen.io; work; Remember to add http:// before the requested API URL.

### Day 13: Mar 10 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the weather API challenge!

**Thoughts**  Reinforced API calls with jQuery; using two API at the same time; converting values back and forth with click button; using Flag;

### Day 14: Mar 18 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on Wikipedia API challenge. Got the random article working. Trying to figure out the search query part

**Thoughts**  Wikipedia API seems to be a lot more complex than previous ones based on how many query modules and info I want to fetch... May need another day or two to finalize it.

## Day 15: May 3 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the Wikipedia project after researching, experimenting and working with people

**Thoughts**  Definitely learnt a lot in terms of researching bigger & more complex API documentation, trial and error, efficient ways to preview data in console etc.
