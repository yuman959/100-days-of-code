### Day 2: Jan 2 2017

**Today's Progress**: The challenge exercise for arrays/objects was a bit confusing but I worked it out. Started functional programming module.

**Thoughts**: I like the arrays/objects challenge. It's just like lists & tables.

### Day 3: Jan 3 2017

**Today's Progress**: Half way to functional programming (advanced objects topic)

**Thoughts** I find it hard to transition to the constructor concept (this expression). The example challenge is very confusing - I just haven't seen enough use cases yet. It will get better.

### Day 5: Jan 7 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on challenges that manipulate strings (split, join, case, pick certain string character etc.)

**Thoughts** There are always multiple ways to solve the same problem. It helps with collateral thinking and critical thinking.
